    <p>Description of the image</p>
    <p>This image shows a car drifting. It is significant to me because I love cars; I am a huge car guy. I love drifting also. I go to car meets, and I usually drift my friends' cars because one of them has a Ford Mustang, and another has a Dodge Challenger. It is not easy drifting, as it requires focus and you have to be careful not to hit other people in the crowd.</p>
    <p>Why did I choose this image?</p>
    <p>I chose this image because cars are basically my life. I love driving, racing, and drifting. This image shows a car drifting, which really stood out to me. The color, the animation, and the background just seem like the perfect spot to drift your car. The stars in the sky really reeled me in.</p>
    <p>Image file type information</p>
