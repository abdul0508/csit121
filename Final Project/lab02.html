    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
         <ol>
         <li> So far I learned in Lab 01 and Lab 02 was how to create my own repository </li>
         <li> I learned how to create my own HTML page and how to verify it </li>
         <li> I learned about the different structural elements.</li>
         </ol>
    
    <ul>
        <li> I learned how to use Visual Studio Code </li>
        <li> I learned about wireprints of an HTML. </li>
        <li> I learned the more I practice creating HTML files the better I can master it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How can I do better?</h3>
        <p> I feel like I could do better by watching more videos and doing my assignments a little earlier as it requires a lot of writing and thinking and proofing ensuring it works and there aren't any errors. I feel like if I practice a little more I could be much better, I know I am not perfect yet but this is actually very exciting and I definitely want to improve.</p>
    <h4> First thoughts on the course</h4>

 <p> At first when I opened the course and everything and when I got my first glimpse, I was terrified I immediately thought I was going to fail this class, but after reviewing the modules and going over the notes and practicing on my own, I eventually got the hang of it, in some ways it was fun taking on this challenge becuase it is something new, I really enjoyed the first 2 Labs and I hope I succeed in the upcoming labs.</p>
