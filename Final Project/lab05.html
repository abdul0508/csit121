    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
         <ol>
         <li> So far I learned was how to create my own repository </li>
         <li> I learned how to create my own HTML page and how to verify it </li>
         <li> I learned about the different structural elements.</li>
         </ol>
        <ul>
        <li> I learned how to use Visual Studio Code </li>
        <li> I learned about wireprints of an HTML. </li>
        <li> I learned the more I practice creating HTML files the better I can master it.</li>
        
     
    </ul>

    <h3>How can I do better?</h3>
        <p> I feel like I could do better by watching more videos and doing my assignments a little earlier as it requires a lot of writing and thinking and proofing ensuring it works and there aren't any errors. I feel like if I practice a little more I could be much better, I know I am not perfect yet but this is actually very exciting and I definitely want to improve.</p>

<div class="grid-item">
    <h4 id="First%20Reflection">First Reflection</h4>
<p>At first when I opened the course and everything and when I got my first glimpse, I was terrified I immediately thought I was going to fail this class, but after reviewing the modules and going over the notes and practicing on my own, I eventually got the hang of it, in some ways it was fun taking on this challenge becuase it is something new, I really enjoyed the first 2 Labs and I hope I succeed in the upcoming labs.</p>

<div class="grid-item">
    <h5 id="Second%20Reflection">Second Reflection</h5>
    <p> Lab 03 was definitely something different. It took me so much practice to perfect it and link these two files together I actually started to get mad. Eventually I figured it out. It feels nice knowing I can add some life to my HTML file and organize it and make it much better. I definitely learned some mistakes from my previous assignments such as not closing my tags and not fixing my errors. This time I closed my tags and fixed my errors and I feel like the more I practice, the better I can get. </p>
    <h6 id="Third%20Reflection">Third Reflection</h6>
    <p>I will be very honest, this assignment, Lab 05 made me very frustrated. I used many resources googled many things and even put in random things in my stylesheets in hopes of getting it to work. No luck, then I realized I don't have my "div" traits. I added that and it looked much better. I was able to add the media queries and make it look nice and so on, I liked it when we were doing easier things but this definitely was a huge challenge.</p>
