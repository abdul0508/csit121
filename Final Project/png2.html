    <p>Description of the image</p>
    <p>This image has 5 of the major tech companies: Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. All of these companies are competitors. They each have their own software, and 4 out of 5 of these companies have their own mobile devices. Together, the combined market cap of those 5 companies is almost 10 trillion dollars. As these companies continue growing and innovating, their market cap will only increase.</p>
    <p>Why did I choose this image?</p>
    <p>I chose this image because I am a huge tech guy. I love seeing new products come out and I constantly research and use these companies' products as well. I use Google every day when I research, I use Apple products such as an iPhone, AirPods, and an Apple Watch. I use Meta services such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. I use Amazon when I watch movies and when I purchase things. I use Microsoft products such as CSS, which is made by Microsoft, or my laptop, which is also made by Microsoft, or my Xbox, which is also made by Microsoft. All of these major tech companies are in my daily life. Their significance is what made me choose this image because I use these companies every day.</p>
    <p>Image file type information</p>

This is ideal for images that need to be high quality such as logos, photos, or screenshots. You can view it in almost any graphic form, and these types of image files are common.</p>
