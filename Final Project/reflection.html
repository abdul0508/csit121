<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>My self-reflection on this project is based mainly on my perseverance. I wanted to make sure unlike the previous projects my mistakes were cleared. Such as my navigation bar not working and being unresponsive and my XML project where it wouldn't display the employees data.I wanted to ensure I cleared up my mistakes in this project so the website could be smooth and be a good experience.</p>
<p>My reflection from this course was it was a awesome course, I learned new things I got to experience new things and there were many times where I definitely had to push myself and persevere through this course. I can genuinely say I enjoyed it and I would love to have you as my professor again in the future.</p>
<p>My observations on testing on mulitple browsers and devices were, make sure you adjust the text sizes and maybe add a function where the background color changes on mobile devices so people have teo different experiences, nobody likes just one experience.</p>
