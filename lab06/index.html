    <p>The website is good at engagement. The way the page is layed out and organized it captivates the readers and makes them scroll more and will make you click other pages and will convince you well enough to sign up, they have some videos that you watch on the homepage to show you what Brainpop is and the graphics when you watch and learn from a video.I think it is appropriate to use as it is designed for young kids.</p>

    <p>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</p>
    <p>One recommendation I would make is, in my eyes is to make the pages more colorful and bright, to me it is colorful in some ways but I feel like they can add much better colors to make the page brighter and more captivating. The better a page looks, the more captivating it is, and the more readers you get. </p>
