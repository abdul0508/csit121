    <p> Description of the image</p>
    <p> This image shows a car drifting. It is signifcant to me because I love cars, I am a huge car guy,  I love difting also, I go to car meets, I usually drift my friends car because his car is a Ford Mustang or my other friend who has  a Dodge Challenger, it is not easy drifting, as it requires focus and you have to be careful not hitting other people in the crowd.</p>
    <p>Why did I choose this image?<p>
    <p> I chose this image because cars are basically my life, I love driving, I love racing and I love drifting, this image shows a car drifting, which really stood out to me, it bought me in and the color, the animation, the background, it just seems like a perfect spot and place to drift your car, the stars in the sky really reeled me in. </p>
