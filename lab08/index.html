    <p> Description of the image</p>
    <p> This image is Lamar Jackson being great, this image shows Lamar Jackson complete a pass against the Washington Commanders. We won this game, 31-17, Lamar threw for two touchdowns and had a huge 50 yard touchdown run.</p>
    <p> Why did I choose this image?</p>
    <p> I chose this image because Lamar Jackson is my favorite player in the NFL, he is the reason why I started loving the Ravens more (not a bandwagon) but Lamar Jackson singlehandedly changed our franchise and increased our fanbase from all over the world, he changed the way quarterbacks play as a dual-threat QB. Lamar Jackson also proved his doubters  wrong many times by winning MVP two times, Lamar Jackson almost let us to a Superbowl many times before being let down by his team, if there are any reasons why we haven't won one, blame our coach.</p>
